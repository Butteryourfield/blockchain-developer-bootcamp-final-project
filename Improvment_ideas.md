## Possible Improvements

1. A more 'random' and fair random number generator... possibly implementing oracles and external computational power/sources
2. Lots of due diligence and things to improve trustability of owner - public blockchains are based on a trustless environment so this may be difficult to convince people, but it is neccesary if the lottery is too succeed
3. Or implement a different approach to ownership of the contract, maybe so that it does not need to be destroyed/redeployed for gas, or no commission taken
4. Automate the lottery in that will automatically declare a winner after a certain period of time rather than relying on owner who could go missing at any moment...
