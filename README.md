# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

# UPDATE - I have the front end and back end finished... but ive run into a number of problems withe connecting the two... for some reason every transaction i try to do using a ganache local blockchain is failing because it wont automatically set the gas limit/price - When i set the gas limit/price myself the ganache blockchain runs out of memory and closes.. - (when i first tried sending tx this did work and i was able to send tx succesfully, but while playing around with these same txs that were succesful, something went wrong and my ganache visual client became rlly laggy, and it stopped being able to open, even when reinstalling it...)
# i dont know whats happening, but i can only think that it may have something to do with my device (as the problem persists even after reinstalling ganache) or my package manager homebrew...
# I have tried many things to get it working but all failing, so i am resorting to resetting my laptop to factory settings and installing node directly rather than through homebrew as this may be the problem...

# Thus itll take longer for me to complete but still planning on completing it...
# I hope to be back at full speed soon...
